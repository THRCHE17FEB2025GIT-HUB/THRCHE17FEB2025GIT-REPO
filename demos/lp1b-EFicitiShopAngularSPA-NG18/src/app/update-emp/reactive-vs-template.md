# Reactive Forms vs Template-Driven Forms in Angular

| Feature           | Reactive Forms                          | Template-Driven Forms               |
|-------------------|----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Setup            | More explicit, defined in component class| More implicit, defined in template  |
| Form Validation  | Functions in component class             | Directives in template             |
| Complex Forms    | Better suited                           | Less ideal                         |
| Learning Curve   | Steeper initially                       | Easier to start                    |
| Performance      | Better for large forms                  | Better for simple forms            |
| Form Structure   | Defined programmatically                | Defined in HTML template           |

## Key Points
- Reactive forms are preferred for complex scenarios
- Template-driven forms are good for simple forms
- Template-driven forms follow Angular's two-way binding pattern
- Reactive forms follow a more functional programming approach
